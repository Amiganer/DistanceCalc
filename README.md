## Installation

* On EDMC's Plugins settings tab press the "Open" button. This reveals the "plugins" folder where EDMC looks for plugins.
* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Thurion/DistanceCalc/releases).
* Open the ".zip" archive that you downloaded and move the "DistanceCalc" folder contained inside into the "plugins" folder.

You will need to re-start EDMC for it to notice the new plugin.
